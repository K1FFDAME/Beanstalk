## Q4 2022 Current Staffing

_Current Bean Sprout Core Staff_
* mistermanifold (FT) _-_ 20,000 Beans a month (paid twice per month)

_Anticipated Q4 2022 Bean Sprout Hires_
* None

## Amounts

We propose a total of 100,000 Beans are minted to fund Bean Sprout through the end of Q4 2022. Bean Sprout currently custodies 73,333 Bean from the Q3 2022 budget. 

## Expected Use of Funds

* 60,000 Beans paid to mistermanifold
* 110,000 Beans issued as grants to newly formed Beanstalk companies

Note: Bean Sprout grants are designed to facilitate incentive alignment among incubated companies, vendors, and other partners. Bean Sprout thoroughly vets the intended use of funds of any grant, and operates with a mandate to drive net Bean demand to the Beanstalk ecosystem.    

Previous examples of Bean Sprout grants include 40,000 Beans to both Halborn and Root, for smart contract security services and legal services, respectively. Both entities have retained their Bean exposure.

## Custody

In Q3, the funds for Bean Sprout will continue to be custodied by a multisig wallet with keys held by various community members and Publius. We propose the following signers for the [Bean Sprout Multisig (BSM)](https://docs.bean.money/governance/bean-sprout/bsm-dashboard).

_BSM Signers_
* mistermanifold (current signer)
* austin (current signer)
* Bean Merchant (current signer)
* Brean (current signer)
* Publius (current signer)
* ereal (current signer)
* aloceros (new signer)

One Publius wallet will be removed. We also propose that mod323 and sweetredbeans serve as backups for the BSM wallet in case a key holder is compromised or unable to perform their duties.

## Snapshot Processes

We will utilize the process for Bean Sprout Proposals (BSPs), as per [BFP-81](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth/proposal/0xa24c368f08093b8a5e27c0b3ae9296eb60272cddc8882434b02a86152d903e59), with the following amendment:

* Proposals to spend more than 25,000 Beans must reach a quorum of 10% of total outstanding Stalk at the time the BSP was submitted to Snapshot and a majority vote For in order to pass—proposals to spend less than or equal to 25,000 Beans are optimistically approved like before.

 For more information on BSPs, please refer to the Farmers’ Almanac [here](https://docs.bean.money/governance/proposals#bsp).

## Competitive Pay

Bean Sprout recognizes that its ability to pay contributors competitive wages is essential to Beanstalk’s long-term success. This budget proposal ensures that it can meet or exceed market rates.

## Effective

Immediately upon commitment.
